## Mrcore Appstub

This repository contains all mrcore appstubs in various flavors.

This `master` branch is empty.  All appstub flavors are found in this repositories branches.

Appstubs require [mrcore5](https://github.com/mrcore5/framework) to operate.  Once you have
an mrcore setup with mrcore/foundation you can install a new app with any appstub flavor like so

	./artisan mrcore:foundation:app:make --template=mrcore5-src myvendor/mynewapp

Where `--template` refers to a branch on this repository.
